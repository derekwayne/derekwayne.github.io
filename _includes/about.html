                 <p style="text-align:left; padding-left:30px;">Iâ€™m often asked why I decided to pursue data science just after graduating from film school. I can remember juggling video editing with calculus, and falling in love with integrals over flashy cuts. I was good at both but I really wanted to challenge myself academically, do something unexpected, and strive to overcome fears of failure. Fast forward to today, and data science has become a fundamental part of who I am, how I think, and how I approach problems. My absolute passion is to communicate parts of this exciting field to others; to both peers and laymen. What I can offer is a strong understanding of modern statistical practice, experience with relevant tools, and enthusiasm for every project I work on.</p>
