The problem of autonomous segmentation of brain tissues has led to research on complex algorithms that model the spatial relationships in three dimensional scans. Particularly it presents a fascinating study of graph partitioning methods. In this project I achieve an accurate segmentation of a full MRI scan of the brain using modern techniques.
